# Messenger-Robot
Messenger Robot using Raspberry Pi 

•	Introduction to ARM cortex A7 microprocessor and architecture along with Broadcom BCM2837B0 SoC.

•	A multitasking robot was designed to display news and notice feeds in a split-screen on a default set browser on the Thin Film Transistor (TFT) mounted on the robot

•	Developed a control console using HTML and PHP which enabled authenticated access to control the motion of the robot.

•	Implemented WebRTC streaming to host a live feed from the PI camera to guide robot’s path using the UV4L server.

•	The UV4L server provided support to host Two-way Audio/video conference using Janus WebRTC gateway and JITSI meet which served as an additional feature to the project.
